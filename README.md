## Usage

To use this website, simply click the "Generate Password" button. Once that is done, the user will be prompted to enter a number between 8 and 128, which will determine the length of the password. After inputting a valid number, the user will be asked whether or not they want their password to include capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Any option the user presses "OK" for will be included in the generated password. You can find the deployed site here: https://lucas-saaler.github.io/Lucas-Saaler-Password-Generator/
